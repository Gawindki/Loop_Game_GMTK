Supposed Duo project for the GMTK-Game Jame.

While discussing what kind of game we want to make, my alleged partner went radio silent and didn't answer me for days.

I made the mistake of waiting for a response instead of starting solo, costing me precious time.

None the less i managed to put something together, even if it is a messy and buggy game, i am proud.

TLDR;
Proof of working on this.
